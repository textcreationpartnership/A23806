            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I now return to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, who have not onely been my Patron, but in other reſpects a conſtant Benefactor; for you were pleaſed to receive me for your Chaplain, and accept my poor pains, for which (to your Noble Generoſity, not to my deſert, be it ſpoken) you gave me, beſides other Favours, a conſiderable allowance.

                     </hi> Noble Sir, you have out-lived many Friends, you have buried many dear Children, and lately parted
<pb facs="tcp:94511:5"/> with a Religious Lady, who drew with you in the Yoke of Marriage above 59 years. [I am not afraid to call her Religious, <hi>Her daily reſpect to the Word and Prayer in private; Her love to the Publick Ordinances; Her ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lord's Day, and her pious care that others ſhould do ſo: Her faſtings and ſoul-afflictings upon occaſion, together with her conſtant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking, are to me undoubted ſigns of her Religious Diſpoſition.</hi>] Theſe afflictions, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which God Almighty hath pleaſed to exerciſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with, you have patiently undergone &amp; overcome, through the Auxiliaries of Reaſon, and Divine Aſſiſtance. But, my Lord, have you learnt to make a right uſe of death of Friends and Relations? This is an hard
<pb facs="tcp:94511:6"/> leſſon which few take forth: let me intreat you to caſt your eye eſpecially upon the ſecond Part of this following Treatiſe, where you ſhall find ſeveral Uſes ſet down; Copy them out in your daily practice, that ſo when the Sun of your life doth ſet, which declines apace, you may go to your Dormitorie in peace.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe Papers do not inform you of what you know not, yet they may ſerve to mind you of what you know. King <hi>Philip</hi> knew that he was a mortal Man, yet he would have his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor</hi> every morning to tell him that he was ſo, uttering theſe words with a loud voice, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>SOme judicious Divines have looked upon theſe following Notes, as a Talent, not to be <hi>buried in a Napkin,</hi> or in a few <hi>ſheets</hi> of Paper in my Study; I therefore reſolved at laſt to <hi>preſs</hi> them for <hi>publick ſervice.</hi> This I can ſay, I have not offered thee that which coſt me nothing: I have ſpent much time and labour in the compoſure of this following Treatiſe. What I have met with in reading that might ſerve for my preſent purpoſe, I have digeſted into a method for thy benefit, and the principal Quotations I have ſet down. A Poſy is not caſt away becauſe made up of ſeveral Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; nor Honey diſtaſted, which the diligent Bee gathers here and there: nor I hope wilt thou like this Book the worſe, becauſe there are ſeveral Quotations in it.</p>
                  <p>The former part of this <hi>Funeral Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief</hi> may teach thee to take patiently the death of Friends. We read <hi>Act. 19.12. That fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body of</hi> Paul <hi>were brought to the ſick, Handkerchiefs, or Aprons, and the Diſeaſes departed from them, and the evil ſpirits went out of them.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94511:7"/> This Handkerchief brought to thee from mine hand, may (through Gods bleſſing) be a means to cure thee of melancholly, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſorrow, diſcontent, and ſuch like diſtempers of ſpirit, which may ariſe at death of Friends and Relations. Mine Arguments are grounded upon Divine Writ; And as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the Sword of <hi>Goliah, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>21.9. There is none like that, give it me:</hi> So ſay I of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Arguments, there are none like them: Theſe are right words, and ſo the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive; Job <hi>6.25. How forcible are right words?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The latter part of this Treatiſe may teach thee ſeveral good uſes which thou oughteſt to make of the death of Friends and Relations. The firſt part is far larger than the ſecond; what though? <hi>A large firſt, makes recompence for the ſhorter ſecond Courſe at any mans Table.</hi> And this I alſo ſay, That though the firſt part be greater in bulk, yet the latter is of greater worth; both parts I hope may in ſome meaſure anſwer expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to what they promiſe; but the latter chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if thou liveſt up to it, may be a means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote thy eternal Salvation, which is the hearty deſire of</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a Friend is going a long Journey, it is a commendable piece of civility to go with him ſome part of the way, and to weep at parting: ſo civil were the people to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 20.37, 38. <hi>they accompanied him to the ſhip, and wept over him.</hi> So when our Friends depart and go to their long-home, from whence they ſhall never return till time ſhall be no more, is it not good manners to accompany them to the Grave, and ſhed ſome tears for them, whom we ſhall ſee no more with mortal eyes? Eccl. 12.5. <hi>Man goeth to his long-home, and the Mourners go about the ſtreets.</hi> The Jews were wont to hire Mourners (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.17, 18. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.16.) and for the moſt part they were women called in Latin <hi>Praeficae:</hi> They
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94511:9"/> profeſt an Art in Mourning and compoſing dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ditties: And for the greater ſolemnity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of worth or eſtate would hire them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Hearſe, and they would mourn for the Dead with ſuch affection, geſture, and lamentation, that they would cauſe others to mourn for company. We find <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2, 4. the Wiſe-man calling the houſe where one dies, <hi>the houſe of Mourning,</hi> which he would not do, if it were not lawful to mourn upon ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. We reade in Scripture how <hi>Abraham</hi> mourned for <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen. 23.2. <hi>Joſeph</hi> for his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 50.10. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wept for <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 34.8. ſo for <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.1. <hi>Eliſha</hi> cryes after <hi>Elijah,</hi> 2 King. 2.12. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> weeps for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chro. 35.25. And under the New-Teſtament we find Act. 8.2. — <hi>devout man carried Stephen to his Burial, and made great Lamentation over him.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 9.36, 37, 39. We find there the Widows embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming charitable <hi>Dorcas</hi> in tears: And before this we reade how <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> wept ſore for their Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11.19, 31, 33. Nay Chriſt himſelf wept, <hi>v.</hi> 35. and the Jews interpreted it as an argument of his love to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, v.</hi> 36. ſo that civility, cuſtom, and love to deceaſed Friends call for weeping upon ſuch an occaſion.</p>
                     <p>It is pronounced as a judgment upon wicked men, when relations ſhed not a tear, nor pay a ſolemn ſigh, but are rather glad to be rid of them; <hi>Job</hi> 27.15. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78.64. ſo God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> that he ſhould die unlamented, and be buried with the <hi>burial of an Aſs,</hi> Jer. 22.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94511:9"/> 18, 19. <hi>Herod</hi> looked on it ſo ſad to die unla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that he gave expreſs command, that when he died, one of every Noble Family in his kingdom ſhould be ſlain,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> 6th Lect. on <hi>Jonah,</hi> p. 124.1.</note> that by that means his death might of neceſſity be lamented, if not for love of him (as the Tyrant had no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) yet for the loſs of others. <hi>Joſeph.

                        <hi>Mors mea non careat Lachrymis,</hi> and let not my death want tears, ſo it be done temperately; is to be preferred before that of <hi>Ennius, Nemo me lachrymis decoret,</hi> Let no man mourn for me.</p>
                     <p>He hath lived <hi>(Tellius inutile pondus)</hi> a very unprofitable wretch, who being dead, is carried forth as ſervants carry out the ſweepings of the Houſe, or guts of Birds, or entrails of Beaſts, without any ſhew of ſorrow: Tears then at death of Friends, are ſilent expreſſions of the uſefulneſs of our dead Friend, (whileſt living) and of our value and eſteem of him.</p>
                     <p>And if we ſeriouſly conſider loſſes of this nature, how can we chuſe but weep? For a wife to loſe her husband, <hi>the Guide of her Youth,</hi> Pro. 2.7. who was a ſhield to defend her, or as the Sun to chear her, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 37.9, 10.) muſt needs be a bitter loſs: So for a Husband to loſe his Wife, the <hi>Wife of his Youth,</hi> Prov. 5.18. or the <hi>Wife of his Boſom,</hi> Mic. 7.5. the <hi>deſire of his eyes,</hi> Ezek. 24.16, 18. muſt needs be a bitter loſs. So for Parents to loſe Children, who have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them, and from whom they expect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their old age, muſt needs be a bitter loſs. So how can Children chuſe but weep at death of Parents? to loſe a <hi>Father that begot them,</hi>

Yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the catalogue of offenders that ſhould come in the laſt dayes (and ſurely ours are the laſt) tells us of ſome that ſhall be (<gap reason="foreign">

Thus <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba's</hi> mourning for her husband <hi>Uriah</hi> (2 Sam. 11.26.) is thought by ſome to be hypocritical; for by his death, ſhe was freed from her husbands rage, from ſhame and puniſhment which ſhe juſtly deſerved; and withal ſhe had hopes to become a Queen, as indeed ſhe did. But let ſuch hypocritical Mourners conſider, without repentance, their portion will be with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, where (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51.) <hi>there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> In Hell there is weeping in good earneſt: And every tear ſhed is ſo far from quenching Hell-fire, that like Oyl it will encreaſe the flame thereof: and here I leave ſuch unnatural wretches.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, ſome there are that at death of Friends weep immoderately, they <hi>weep till they can weep no more,</hi> as the expreſſion is 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.4. they are ſo impatient, that for ever after they lead diſconſolate lives, ſitting daily <hi>inter ſuſpiria &amp; lachrymas,</hi> ſighing, ſobbing, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing: they are ſo diſcompoſed, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as the Apoſtle commands, <hi>attend upon the Lord without diſtraction,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.35. They cannot pray, nor meditate, nor give thanks to God with that fixedneſs and compoſure as they ought to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. And it may be they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear going to Church, becauſe they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

So, Eccleſ. 12.5. <hi>Man goeth to his long home;</hi> Man indefinitely, <hi>i. e.</hi> every man, high and low, rich and poor, beautiful and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, male and female, young and old, good and bad, all go to their long home, the Grave. So <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.48. <hi>What man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee Death?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Dugards</hi> Sermon on that Text.</note> 
                        <hi>Shall he deliver his ſoul from the hand of the Grave? Selah.</hi> No, though he now liveth, yet he ſhall not alway live, but ſooner or later ſhall ſee Death. <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>David</hi> call Death, <hi>The Way of all the Earth,</hi> Joſh. 23.14. 1 King. 2.2. This way all Creatures of the Earth walk, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> calls the Grave, <hi>The Houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all Living,</hi> Job. 30.23. <hi>No man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit, Eccleſ.</hi> 8.8. But when his time is come, <hi>The Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.7. Death, that black Prince, or <hi>King of Terrors</hi> (So called <hi>Job</hi> 18.14.) is an invincible Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, who riding on his pale Horſe, for above theſe five thouſand years, hath with an impartial

The long-liv'd Patriarchs, <hi>Adam, Seth, Enoch, &amp;c.</hi> like ſtout Oaks held out long, but were forced at laſt to ſubmit to Death's fatal ſtroak, as you my read, <hi>Gen. Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori.</hi> Heb. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye.</hi> It is <hi>Statute Law,</hi> enacted in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the decree is eſtabliſted, the writing ſigned, and like the <hi>Laws of the Medes and Perſians,</hi> (Dan. chap. 6. verſ. 8.) <hi>never to be reverſed,</hi> whileſt this world laſteth; we onely read of two exempted ſince the Creation of the World, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> who though they dyed not, yet underwent a change, and the like is not now to be expected. So then that all muſt dye is an univerſal rule, admitting of no exception: And how ſoon all we may be brought in as Examples to this general Rule, we know not. Even Kings on Earth are but Earthen Kings, and like <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars Image</hi> (Dan. 2.) <hi>ſtand on feet of clay,</hi> and moulder away as well as others. <hi>Aequo pede pulſat pauperum tabernas, regum<expan>

He ſtood guilty of our ſins (for he became our Surety) and therefore underwent a diſſolution, though indeed he ſaw no corruption, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13.37. Now as <hi>Phocion</hi> ſaid to one that was condemned to the ſame death with him. <hi>Art thou not glad to fare as Phocion doth?</hi> So ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94511:13"/> we be too much caſt down at death of our Friends, ſeeing the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nay Chriſt himſelf hath taſted death's bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cup. Well then, at death of your Friend conſider that, <hi>Job</hi> 21.33. <hi>Every man ſhall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</hi> Me-thinks this ſhould ſomewhat alleviate our ſorrow.<note place="margin">

So it is ſaid of <hi>David, Acts</hi> 8.36. <hi>After he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, fell aſleep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Will of God,</hi> may be annexed to his <hi>falling aſleep,</hi> as well as <hi>ſerving his generation;</hi> he dyed then by the will of God, and was gathered to his Fathers, and ſaw corruption. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 30.23. <hi>I know that thou wilt bring me unto death, and to the houſe appointed for all living. Naomi</hi> ſaid, when ſhe was deprived of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and two Sons in a ſtrange Land, <hi>The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath dealt very bitterly with me, and the Lord hath teſtifyed againſt me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me,</hi> Ruth 1.5, 20, 21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. So <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking of the frailty and ſhortneſs of mans life, ſaith, <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayeſt, Return ye children of men,</hi> Pſal. 90.3. Gods <hi>dixit</hi> is his <hi>fecit;</hi> (as in the firſt Creation he ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94511:15"/> there was light,</hi> Gen. 1.3.) So God here ſaith, <hi>Return, i. e.</hi> he makes them to return <hi>(viz.)</hi> to their Original, <hi>The Body to the earth, and the Spirit to him that gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.7. So <hi>David,</hi> tells us, <hi>God takes away mens breath, and then they dye and return to their duſt,</hi> Pſal. 104.29. God indeed is the orderer and ordainer of all conditions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he brings down to the grave, and bringeth up.</hi> So Iſa. 45.7. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil; I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, not a <hi>Sparrow falls to the ground, nor a hair from our heads, without the overruling providence of God,</hi> Mat. 10.29, 30. Here is <hi>Argumentum a minore ad majus,</hi> If not a Sparrow, a bird of ſmall price and account, or an Hair, which is no eſſential part, but made for convenience and ornament; if theſe fall not to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of our heavenly Father, ſurely a Friend cannot dye but God wills it. Let us then at loſs of Friends patiently ſubmit to Gods will. The <hi>Heatheniſh Idolaters</hi> were loth to caſt <hi>Jonah</hi> overboard, but when they had caſt lots, and found it to be Gods will it ſhould be ſo, they patiently ſubmitted, 1 <hi>Jonah</hi> 13.14. Let not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens outſtrip Chriſtians. Let us ſay with Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 18.11. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> See <hi>Jobs</hi> carriage <hi>Job</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. <hi>He fell down and worſhipped, not murmured; he charged not God fooliſhly,</hi> by railing as though he dealt unjuſtly with him, but ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken;</hi> He ſaw the hand of God in whatever
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94511:15"/> befel him, and this was a ſtrong pillar of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his drooping ſpirit.

Let Gods authority over thee prevent impatience in thee. <hi>God who doth what he will, and will do what he pleaſeth, Pſal.</hi> 115.3.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It is unſutable to a Chriſtian's Spirit.</hi> It is below the magnanimous ſpirit of a Chriſtian to take notice of worldly diſreſpect. <hi>Noah</hi> met with much diſreſpect from the Old World, yet he binds their jeers, taunts, and reproaches as a Crown to his head, and advanceth couragiouſly forward in the race of Chriſtianity.

He thought it not worth while to take notice of worldly diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Let not Chriſtians for ſhame come ſhort of Heathens.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is unſutable to a Chriſtians Profeſſion,</hi> They profeſs themſelves not to be of this World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19, 20. and therefore no wonder that they are diſreſpected by the world, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. ſo 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>Marvel not my Brethren if the World hate you.</hi> Believers confeſs they are Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. Strangers look for no great reſpect, being from home in a far country. Strangers are content with mean uſage, they know they ſhall be much made of when they are in their own country.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>It is unſutable to a Chriſtians practice.</hi> Wicked men are deſirous of vain-glory, witneſs <hi>Phaeroh, Haman, Herod,</hi> &amp;c. but for the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94511:66"/> the more holy; the more humble; and the leſs they care for worldly reſpect. A veſſel upon the water the more it fills the more it ſinks; the weightieſt ears of corn bow down their heads the loweſt. <hi>Ezra</hi> cryes out, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are encreaſed over our head, and our treſpaſs is grown up unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> So wiſe <hi>Agur</hi> confeſſeth he is <hi>more brutiſh then any man,</hi> Prov. 30.2.

True Godlineſs dryes up all ambitious humours.

                     </p>
                     <p>There is ſcarce a day paſſeth over our heads but God doth try our patience in one kind or other. <hi>Job</hi> 5.7. <hi>Man is born to trouble as the ſparks fly upward.</hi> Prov. 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> Every day, like a big-bellied woman, is with child of ſomewhat, and we know not before-hand what trouble it may produce, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great or ſmall, but <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof. q. d.</hi> Every day may bring enough grief and vexation with it, do
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94511:103"/> not by diſtracting care antedate the evil of it, or add ſorrow to it. A Diſciple of Chriſt muſt <hi>take up his croſs daily,</hi> Luke 9.23. If we daily bear leſſer afflictions patiently, we may be inabled to bear ſtronger tryals. St. <hi>Paul</hi> by inuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bear leſſer croſſes which he daily met with he could in time bear the greateſt that God did lay upon him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. <hi>I have learnt in what ever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> Nay, he makes a <hi>light</hi> matter of all afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. The Prophet tells us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27. <hi>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</hi> Much good comes by a timely bearing the croſs: It will make a man ſuffer willingly, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>He ſits alone and keeps ſilence, becauſe he hath born it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi> It will make a man ſuffer humbly, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>He putteth his mouth in the duſt:</hi> It will make him ſuffer willingly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>He gives his cheek to him that ſmiteth him. Milo</hi> could carry a Bull, being uſed to carry it daily when it was a Calf; by daily bearing leſſer troubles you may be enabled for greater tryals. But if you ſink under light burthens, what will you do when great ones come?</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94511:109"/> made nearer unto you by Marriage than either Father or Mother. I call her one of Gods Jewels (ſuch there are <hi>Mal. 3.17.</hi>) ſhe was little of ſtature, but of great worth: She was a <hi>Great Fortune,</hi> but, which is more conſiderable, ſhe was an <hi>huge good</hi> perſon. <hi>She was a conſtant frequenter of the Ordinances, a ſtrict obſerver of the Sabbath; her Family-devotion was great, and her ſecret ejaculations fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and conſtant. She was meek, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, chaſte, courteous, charitable, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, humble,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe and the like Virtues came ſtreaming into her Soul from the Fountain of Divine Grace. She was no ſcoffing <hi>Michal,</hi> nor you a churliſh <hi>Nabal:</hi> The onely ſtrife betwixt you was this, which ſhould ſhew moſt dearneſs and tenderneſs; ſo pleaſing was your deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment each to other, that one would think, one Soul animated two Bodyes. You did never grieve her Spirit but by your exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive grief to ſee her in that extreamity of<note place="margin">She dyed in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> pain; which, with greateſt care you could not remedy, and with admirable patience and Chriſtian courage ſhe chearfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94511:109"/> She was not afraid of Death. Though ſhe loved her Husband as dearly as any Chriſtian ought to do, yet ſhe loved him much leſs than her Saviour, and ſhe knew that Death would bring her to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſight of him; and I doubt not but ſhe is with him whom her ſoul longed for.</p>
                  <p>What remains, ſweet Sir, but that you look upon your ſelf, at leaſt as half dead, and become a moſt ſerious and mortified man. I know when God firſt ſnatched this precious Jewel out of your boſom, you were ſadly affected with your loſs (indeed her Funerals were celebrated with great ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with many a weeping eye and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart) let not ſenſual delights make you to forget it. Labour to get good by this affliction: Let her Memory be ſtill preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with you, not for adoration (leave that foppery, to the Papiſts) but for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And that you may make a right uſe of this, and ſuch like loſſes, which have and may ſtill befal you, let me entreat you to peruſe this

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94511:112"/> Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> and, as they ſaid, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>It is vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Even <hi>Job</hi> that eminent Servant of God, lying under ſad afflictions, the ſaddeſt of which were the loſs of his Children; though you read, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. That <hi>in all this,</hi> or hitherto <hi>Job ſinned not, nor charged God fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly;</hi> ſo the like you read, <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when affliction did lodge with him, and he began to be wet to the skin, we find him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering many unſavoury ſpeeches: In the third Chapter you find him curſing the day of his birth: And Chap. 6. ver. 8, 9. he wiſheth <hi>God would deſtroy him, and cut him off:</hi> And chapt. 16.9. he ſaid, <hi>God hated him;</hi> and chap. 30.21. he ſaid, <hi>God was become cruel to him.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> lying under much affliction whilſt the wicked proſpered, had much ado to keep his feet in the wayes of Godlineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2. <hi>As for me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt:</hi> and ver. 13, 14. <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency; for all the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtened every morning.</hi> But though God's Children through the prevalency of temptation have ſpoken unbeſeeming things of God and his Ways, yet upon ſecond thoughts (which are ever<note n="†" place="margin">Secundae cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores.</note> better) they have humbled themſelves for ſuch ſpeeches. So did <hi>Job,</hi> Job 42.3, 6 compared. And the like did <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 73.22. he confeſſeth there, that in ſpeaking diſhonourably of God and his wayes, he had
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94511:112"/> played the fool, and acted the part of a Beaſt rather than a Chriſtian; and <hi>ver.</hi> 28. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>That it was good for him to draw near to God.</hi> It is good for us under greateſt loſſes to draw near to God, and to have good thoughts of him and his wayes: for, as <hi>Azariah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aſa, Judah,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you while you be with him: And if ye ſeek him, hee'l be found of you: but if you forſake him, hee'l forſake you.</hi> So Ezra 9.22. <hi>The hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him; but his power and his wrath is againſt all them that forſake him.</hi> Heb. 10.38. God's <hi>Soul hath no pleaſure in ſuch as draw back;</hi> they that draw back, do it to their perdition, <hi>v.</hi> 39. O then, part not with your Religion when you part with your Friends; neither have hard thoughts of God: Look upon him with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Spectacles, which repreſent him to be (as indeed he is) a moſt wiſe, juſt, holy, faithful, and merciful God. Even in his <hi>terrible Acts</hi> there is abundance of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> appears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.6, 7. His end and deſign is (as you heard in the former Treatiſe) to purge out ſin, to implant holineſs in thee, and ſo to fit thee for future happineſs.

                           </q> Death is a Sleep, and the Coffin a Couch; <hi>In quo illé mollius dormit quiſquis durius in hâc vità ſe gèſſerit.</hi> Ambroſ.

                        <p>Though Spectacles of Mortality adminiſter Comfort to the Righteous under Affliction, yet they may ſtrike terror into the hearts of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Wretches: for they may reade their own death in the death of their Friends.

The wiſe Man tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to die.</hi> What, no time to live?

Oh did we but ſee the Glaſs of our Life running, many of us would ſee but little Sand remaining.

All that are fitted for death, are <hi>Benoni</hi>'s, Sons of Sorrow, and their tears for ſin are ſo many diſſolved Pearls.

                        <p>That there will be a Reſurrection of the Body is clear from Scripture: Inſomuch that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our told the <hi>Sadduces</hi> which ſaid there is no Reſurrection, Matth. 22.29. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> When Jeſus told <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> that her Brother ſhould riſe again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.23. ſhe replyed, verſ. 24. <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt Day.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpends the largeſt Chapter in all his Epiſtles in proving this Point againſt ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> who denied it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. Well then, at Chriſts ſecond coming to Judgment, we muſt all riſe again with our own bodies, and give an account of our own Works, as you may ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. This will be a joyful day to ſuch as have lived in expectation of it, and preparation for it. For <hi>when Chriſt their life appears, they ſhall appear with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. They ſhall have a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs</hi> conferred upon them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. They ſhall riſe <hi>to everlaſting life,</hi> Dan. 12.2. <hi>John</hi> 5.29. They ſhall lift up their heads with joy; They <hi>ſhall have confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his coming,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.28. For he who is their Saviour, Surety, Interceſſor, Head, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94511:156"/> Husband, will be their Judge. He will at that day gather them together, and place them on his right hand, and pronounce that bleſſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Mat. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</hi> They ſhall be <hi>Aſſeſſores in judicio,</hi> like Juſtices of the Peace upon the Bench, with the Judge approving of that righteous Sentence which Chriſt ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon the wicked, both Men and Devils. 1 Cor. 6.2, 3. <hi>Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the World? — Know ye not that we ſhall judge Angels?</hi>

                           <hi>This,</hi> and much more, <hi>honour have all the Saints</hi> in that great day. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon ſuch happineſs as ſhall never end; Dan. 12.3. — <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, — and as the Stars for ever and ever;</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the Apoſtle had ſpoken of the Reſurrection and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt, he tells us that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhall <hi>be for ever with the Lord,</hi> verſ. 17. And then he adds, <hi>Comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> verſ. 18. This eternal happineſs will make amends for all our pains and care in our Chriſtian courſe.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee how comfortable their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that live in continual expection of Death, and preparation for Death. They live comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, they die comfortably, and they ſhall riſe again with comfort. Whereas on the other ſide, if men be careleſs herein, they have no true comfort whilſt they live, even <hi>in laughter their heart is ſorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs,</hi> Prov. 14.13. So it was with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi>
                           <pb n="298" facs="tcp:94511:157"/> Dan. 5.4, 5. God ſaith again and again by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> That <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 48.22. &amp; 57.21. And if they have no true peace and comfort whilſt they live, I am ſure they have none when they come to die. As <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſo may a wicked man ſay upon the approach of Death, 1 King. 21.20. <hi>Haſt thou found me, O mine Enemy?</hi> Death to him is the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> as <hi>Bildad</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> call'd it, <hi>Job</hi> 18.14.

                           </gap>, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo terrible to him as Death. The Soul at ſuch a time is uſually full of horrors and heavy apprehenſions: <hi>Pangs of Death, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conſcience, ſenſe of Guilt, and frights of Hell, are ſufficient to render him perfectly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> If there be any wicked men that die with little ſenſe of pain, and leſs fear of Death, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4.) we muſt know that this is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſenſleſs ſtupidity, no true peace. And if they have no true peace and comfort neither in life nor at death, they'l have none after death, nor at the general Reſurrection; for no ſooner is the ſoul ſeparated from the body, but God paſſeth a particular judgment upon it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. and dooms it to miſery: <hi>Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah — <hi>are ſet forth for an Example, ſuffering the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire,</hi> Jude 7. And at the ſecond coming of Chriſt to Judgment, the body ſhall riſe, and be reunited to the ſoul, and Chriſt will pronounce that dreadful Sentence upon all wicked perſons, Mat. 25.41. <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94511:157" rendition="simple:additions"/> angels.</hi> And this Sentence being once paſs'd, ſhall never be alter'd: Hence it is called <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment,</hi> Heb. 6.2. If <hi>Felix</hi> trembled to hear of judgment to come, as you may read he did, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. How will wicked men tremble when Chriſt comes to execute Judgment upon them, (as you read he will, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. &amp; 12. laſt verſ. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>Jude</hi> 15.) Wicked men will then <hi>cry to the Hills to fall upon them, and hide them from the face of him that ſits upon the Throne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16, 17. They would then count it an happineſs to be able to die; but alas, <hi>They ſhall ſeek for death, but they ſhall not find it, and they ſhall deſire to die, but death ſhall flee from them,</hi> Rev. 9.6. So then wicked men ſhall riſe again, but it will be to their <hi>everlaſting ſhame</hi> and miſery, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2.

                  <p>Now that God doth ſometimes deliver his, when nigh unto death, is clear; 1.

Thus it was with <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> in my Text, who <hi>being ſick, nigh unto death, the Lord had mercy on him.

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>This Conſideration affords comfort to God's Servants under ſickneſs and deadly dangers.</hi> See that former-quoted place, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 68.20. <hi>He that is our God, is the God of Salvation; and to God the Lord belongs the iſſues from death.</hi> This God, whom the Righteous are related to, and have an intereſt in, can help in greateſt ſtraits, and ſend in deliverance when they are nigh unto death, and ſtand in moſt need of help.

See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11, 12, 13. God like a skilful Bone-ſetter or Chyrurgeon <hi>can bind up the breach of his People, and heal the ſtroak of their Wound,</hi> as the expreſſion is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26.

I end this with that of the Evangelical Prophet, Iſa. 50.10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his Servant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light?</hi> (a Child of light it ſeems may walk in darkneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> have little or no comfort for the preſent, yet) <hi>let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> Let him ſtill wait on God prayingly, believingly, obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in God's due time, which is ever beſt, comfort will come.</p>
